## **Code Structure**  
- **`main()`**: The main game loop handling movement, rotation, and collision.  
- **`draw()`**: Displays the Tetris grid and active Tetromino.  
- **`check()`**: Ensures that a move or rotation is valid.  
- **`hardDrop()`**: Instantly drops the piece to the lowest position.  
- **`rotation logic`**: Uses **pivot-based rotation** for Tetrominoes.

## **Troubleshooting**  
### **Game Doesn't Compile?**  
- Ensure **g++ or another compiler** is installed.  
- Use **C++11 or higher** for compatibility:  
  ```sh
  g++ -std=c++11 tetris.cpp -o tetris
  ```

### **Screen Flickering?**  
- Try running the game in **fullscreen mode**.  
- Modify `system("cls");` to use **buffered drawing techniques**.  

### **Game Closes Instantly?**  
- Run the executable **from a terminal or command prompt**.  
- Add `system("pause");` at the end of `main()` to prevent the window from closing.
